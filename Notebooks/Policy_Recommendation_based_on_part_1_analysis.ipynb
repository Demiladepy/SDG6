        "Based on the analysis of the WHO/UNICEF JMP dataset, we propose a multi-tiered policy framework to improve access to safe and affordable drinking water globally:\n",

        "### 1.  Prioritize Rural Infrastructure Investment\n",
        "- Rural areas consistently show lower access to basic services and higher reliance on surface and unimproved water.\n",
        "- Governments and NGOs should allocate targeted funding for rural water systems, especially in low-income countries.\n",

        "---\n",

        "### 2.  Leverage Urbanization for Scalable Solutions\n",
        "- Urban areas demonstrate higher and more consistent access levels.\n",
        "- Urban water delivery models can be adapted for rural deployment, with attention to local context and sustainability.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3.  Target Low-Income Countries for Accelerated Support\n",
        "- Low-income countries face the highest population burden, longest water retrieval times, and greatest service gaps.\n",
        "- International aid and development programs should prioritize these regions for infrastructure, training, and monitoring.\n",

        "- Policies should be informed by disaggregated data (urban vs. rural, income group, population size) to ensure equitable outcomes.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.  Monitor and Adjust Based on Service-Level Trends\n",
        "- Regularly track shifts in basic, limited, unimproved, and surface water access.\n",
        "- Use data dashboards and community feedback to refine interventions and ensure accountability.\n",
